Lists:
Ordered, mutable sequence of elements.
Elements can be of different data types.
Accessed by index.
Common operations include appending, inserting, and slicing.

Tuples:
Similar to lists but immutable (cannot be modified after creation).
Often used for heterogeneous data.

Sets:
Unordered collection of unique elements.
Useful for membership testing and eliminating duplicates.

Dictionaries:
Unordered collection of key-value pairs.
Keys are unique and immutable.
Efficient for lookups.

Strings:
Immutable sequences of characters.
Can be indexed and sliced.
Many built-in string methods for manipulation.

Arrays:
Provided by the array module.
Similar to lists but more efficient for numeric elements of the same type.

Queues:
Provided by the queue module.
Implements the queue data structure (First In, First Out - FIFO).

Stacks:
Can be implemented using lists or the queue module.
Implements the stack data structure (Last In, First Out - LIFO).
