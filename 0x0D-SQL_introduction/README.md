**Structured Query Language (SQL) - Brief Notes:**

1. **Definition:**
   - SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used to manage and manipulate relational databases.

2. **Purpose:**
   - SQL is primarily used for querying, updating, and managing data within relational database management systems (RDBMS).

3. **Categories:**
   - SQL commands are categorized into Data Query Language (DQL), Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Data Control Language (DCL).

4. **Basic Commands:**
   - **SELECT:** Retrieves data from one or more tables.
   - **INSERT:** Adds new records into a table.
   - **UPDATE:** Modifies existing records in a table.
   - **DELETE:** Removes records from a table.
   - **CREATE:** Defines database objects (tables, indexes, etc.).
   - **ALTER:** Modifies the structure of an existing database object.
   - **DROP:** Deletes a database object.

5. **Data Types:**
   - SQL supports various data types such as VARCHAR, INT, DATE, etc., to define the type of data that can be stored in a column.

6. **Constraints:**
   - Constraints ensure data integrity, e.g., PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL.

7. **Joins:**
   - SQL enables the combination of data from multiple tables using JOIN operations (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN).

8. **Aggregation:**
   - Aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN are used to perform calculations on groups of rows.

9. **Transactions:**
   - SQL supports transactions, allowing a series of SQL commands to be executed as a single unit, ensuring consistency and atomicity.

10. **Views:**
    - Views are virtual tables generated from the result of a SELECT query, providing a way to simplify complex queries or secure sensitive data.

11. **Indexes:**
    - Indexes improve query performance by providing a quick lookup mechanism for data retrieval.

12. **Security:**
    - SQL includes Data Control Language (DCL) commands like GRANT and REVOKE to manage access permissions.

13. **Normalization:**
    - The process of organizing data to minimize redundancy and dependency is called normalization. It helps maintain data integrity.

14. **Triggers:**
    - Triggers are SQL statements that automatically execute in response to specific events, such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
